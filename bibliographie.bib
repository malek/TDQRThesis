  abstract = {Aging roads and poor road-maintenance systems result a large number of potholes, whose numbers increase over time. Potholes jeopardize road safety and transportation efficiency. Moreover, they are often a contributing factor to car accidents. To address the problems associated with potholes, the locations and size of potholes must be determined quickly. Sophisticated road-maintenance strategies can be developed using a pothole database, which requires a specific pothole-detection system that can collect pothole information at low cost and over a wide area. However, pothole repair has long relied on manual detection efforts. Recent automatic detection systems, such as those based on vibrations or laser scanning, are insufficient to detect potholes correctly and inexpensively owing to the unstable detection of vibration-based methods and high costs of laser scanning-based methods. Thus, in this paper, we introduce a new pothole-detection system using a commercial black-box camera. The proposed system detects potholes over a wide area and at low cost. We have developed a novel pothole-detection algorithm specifically designed to work with the embedded computing environments of black-box cameras. Experimental results are presented with our proposed system, showing that potholes can be detected accurately in real-time.},

  abstract = {Many conventional distinction methods of road surface condition using car-mounted cameras have been already proposed. However, most of these methods are only effective for daytime and bright conditions. Therefore, we need to expand these methods for impractical night-time that is much more dangerous environment. In this paper, we propose a new distinction method for road surface conditions at night-time, such as dry, wet and snow. This method uses only video information acquired by an inexpensive car-mounted video camera and uses the difference in road surface features for each condition. The image features of the road surface are depending on the illuminant conditions such as street lamps, signal lights, reflections and other lighting sources. Therefore, we analyze the image features based on color information and the presence of other light sources. As a result, the distinction of road surface conditions was achieved with high accuracy, including the areas illuminated by street lamps and other light sources.},

  abstract = {The importance of the road infrastructure for the society could be compared with importance of blood vessels for humans. To ensure road surface quality it should be monitored continuously and repaired as necessary. The optimal distribution of resources for road repairs is possible providing the availability of comprehensive and objective real time data about the state of the roads. Participatory sensing is a promising approach for such data collection. The paper is describing a mobile sensing system for road irregularity detection using Android OS based smart-phones. Selected data processing algorithms are discussed and their evaluation presented with true positive rate as high as 90\% using real world data. The optimal parameters for the algorithms are determined as well as recommendations for their application.},
