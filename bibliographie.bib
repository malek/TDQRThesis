  abstract = {Monitoring road and traffic conditions in a city is a problem widely studied. Several methods have been proposed towards addressing this problem. Several proposed techniques require dedicated hardware such as GPS devices and accelerometers in vehicles [7][15][8] or cameras on roadside and near traffic signals [13]. All such methods are expensive in terms of monetary cost and human effort required. We propose Wolverine - a non-intrusive method that uses sensors present on smartphones. We extend a prior study [12] to improve the algorithm based on using accelerometer, GPS and magnetometer sensor readings for traffic and road conditions detection. We are specifically interested in identifying braking events - frequent braking indicates congested traffic conditions - and bumps on the roads to characterize the type of road. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method based on experiments conducted on the roads in Mumbai, with promising results.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates an application of mobile sensing: detecting and reporting the surface conditions of roads. We describe a system and associated algorithms to monitor this important civil infrastructure using a collection of sensor-equipped vehicles. This system, which we call the Pothole Patrol (P2), uses the inherent mobility of the participating vehicles, opportunistically gathering data from vibration and GPS sensors, and processing the data to assess road surface conditions. We have deployed P2 on 7 taxis running in the Boston area. Using a simple machine-learning approach, we show that we are able to identify potholes and other severe road surface anomalies from accelerometer data. Via careful selection of training data and signal features, we have been able to build a detector that misidentifies good road segments as having potholes less than 0.2\% of the time. We evaluate our system on data from thousands of kilometers of taxi drives, and show that it can successfully detect a number of real potholes in and around the Boston area. After clustering to further reduce spurious detections, manual inspection of reported potholes shows that over 90\% contain road anomalies in need of repair.},

  abstract = {Driving style can characteristically be divided into two categories: ``typical'' (non-aggressive) and aggressive. Understanding and recognizing driving events that fall into these categories can aid in vehicle safety systems. Potentially-aggressive driving behavior is currently a leading cause of traffic fatalities in the United States. More often than not, drivers are unaware that they commit potentially-aggressive actions daily. To increase awareness and promote driver safety, we are proposing a novel system that uses Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and smartphone based sensor-fusion (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, GPS, video) to detect, recognize and record these actions without external processing. Our system differs from past driving pattern recognition research by fusing related inter-axial data from multiple sensors into a single classifier. It also utilizes Euler representation of device attitude (also based on fused data) to aid in classification. All processing is done completely on the smartphone.},

However, most of these methods are only effective for daytime and bright conditions. Therefore, we need to expand these methods for impractical night-time that is much more dangerous environment. In this paper, we propose a new distinction method for road surface conditions at night-time, such as dry, wet and snow. This method uses only video information acquired by an inexpensive car-mounted video camera and uses the difference in road surface features for each condition. The image features of the road surface are depending on the illuminant conditions such as street lamps, signal lights, reflections and other lighting sources. Therefore, we analyze the image features based on color information and the presence of other light sources. As a result, the distinction of road surface conditions was achieved with high accuracy, including the areas illuminated by street lamps and other light sources.},

Participatory sensing is a promising approach for such data collection. The paper is describing a mobile sensing system for road irregularity detection using Android OS based smart-phones. Selected data processing algorithms are discussed and their evaluation presented with true positive rate as high as 90\% using real world data.

  abstract = {We consider the problem of monitoring road and traffic conditions in a city. Prior work in this area has required the deployment of dedicated sensors on vehicles and/or on the roadside, or the tracking of mobile phones by service providers. Furthermore, prior work has largely focused on the developed world, with its relatively simple traffic flow patterns. In fact, traffic flow in cities of the developing regions, which comprise much of the world, tends to be much more complex owing to varied road conditions (e.g., potholed roads), chaotic traffic (e.g., a lot of braking and honking), and a heterogeneous mix of vehicles (2-wheelers, 3-wheelers, cars, buses, etc.). To monitor road and traffic conditions in such a setting, we present Nericell, a system that performs rich sensing by piggybacking on smartphones that users carry around with them. In this demo, we show the use of accelerometer to detect bumps and braking. We also use the microphone to enable honk detection. Nericell addresses several challenges including virtually reorienting the accelerometer on a phone that is at an arbitrary orientation, and performing honk detection and localization in an energy efficient manner.},
