  abstract = {Over the past decade, self-tracking devices and apps have been increasingly used for personal data collection, particularly in the monitoring of health and physical activity. Data visualization is crucial to helping people understand and make sense of collected data. The literature review carried out on this topic revealed several studies which focus on data visualization, personal informatics systems and people's self-tracking practice and their requirements. However, in terms of personal health data, there is a significant limitation in addressing the knowledge gap between these areas and the visualizations supported by self-tracking apps/dashboards, which people frequently use when viewing and exploring their health data.},

Based on the delivery system, ePHR systems are classified into standalone, tethered, and integrated or unified ePHRs. While national approaches of implementing integrated ePHR vary, the middle out method has been recognised as the ideal approach. It is worth considering the adoption of ePHRs has been slow due to several factors, including technical, individual, environmental, social, and legal factors. This paper provides a representative overview of an ePHR system, outlining its definition, types, architectures, and nationwide approaches of its implementation. Additionally, the drivers and hindrances to health consumer adoption are discussed.},

Several proposed techniques require dedicated hardware such as GPS devices and accelerometers in vehicles [7][15][8] or cameras on roadside and near traffic signals [13]. All such methods are expensive in terms of monetary cost and human effort required. We propose Wolverine - a non-intrusive method that uses sensors present on smartphones. We extend a prior study [12] to improve the algorithm based on using accelerometer, GPS and magnetometer sensor readings for traffic and road conditions detection. We are specifically interested in identifying braking events - frequent braking indicates congested traffic conditions - and bumps on the roads to characterize the type of road. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method based on experiments conducted on the roads in Mumbai, with promising results.},

@misc{EthicsFraudEbanking,
  title = {Ethics and Fraud in {{E-banking}} Services},
  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the importance of ethics applied to everyday moral problems arising from the use of e-banking services. These services have advantages in financial transactions, but security threats and vulnerabilities must be constantly reduced. In this framework raises the ``good citizen'' that desires to do well and needs to avoid harmful behavior [1]. While the ``bad citizen'' promotes the lack of transparency, wrong attitudes and ``hidden'' awareness of the nature, level and scope of the financial impact which claims to reduce the social responsibility [2] and produces high level of degree of materialistic values were less likely to acquire moral [3]. Indeed, the integration of fraud on all aspects of the e-banking services requires the profound revision of the traditional commercial paradigms that have been prevailed for last years. Thus, on the one hand, the theoretical framework of this paper is based on literature about ethics and fraud, in general, and information and communication technology of the e-banking services, in particular. On the other hand, the empirical framework reflects the practices in this field of research used by banks with public data available on the Portuguese Banking Association. The results of the paper show several threats, vulnerabilities, incidents, impacts and response that face e-banking services. To mitigate these risks, the main challenge is the public discussion that will promote prevention and disclosure evidence-based incidents, not only to endorse an adequate behavior but, also, to develop guidance on practical evidence on ethics and reduce fraud.},

These somewhat contradictory objectives have to be applied very carefully to computerised biomedical information. Ethical principles have to be made clear to everyone, and society should take the necessary steps to organise their enforcement. Several examples are given in the delivery of health care, telediagnosis, patient follow-up, clinical research as well as possible breakthroughs that could jeopardise privacy, using biomedical information.},

  abstract = {The haversine formula determines the great-circle distance between two points on a sphere given their longitudes and latitudes. Important in navigation, it is a special case of a more general formula  in spherical trigonometry, the law of haversines, that relates the sides and angles of spherical triangles. The first table of haversines in English was published by James Andrew in 1805, but Florian Cajori credits an earlier use by Jos\'e de Mendoza y R\'ios in 1801. The term haversine was coined in 1835 by James Inman.These names follow from the fact that they are customarily written in terms of the haversine function, given by hav(\texttheta ) = sin2(\texttheta/2). The formulas could equally be written in terms of any multiple of the haversine, such as the older versine function (twice the haversine). Prior to the advent of computers, the elimination of division and multiplication by factors of two proved convenient enough that tables of haversine values and logarithms were included in 19th- and early 20th-century navigation and trigonometric texts.  These days, the haversine form is also convenient in that it has no coefficient in front of the sin2 function.},

This paper will present recent research using Big Data tools and approaches for the analysis of Health Informatics data gathered at multiple levels, including the molecular, tissue, patient, and population levels. In addition to gathering data at multiple levels, multiple levels of questions are addressed: human-scale biology, clinical-scale, and epidemic-scale.

Understanding and recognizing driving events that fall into these categories can aid in vehicle safety systems. Potentially-aggressive driving behavior is currently a leading cause of traffic fatalities in the United States. More often than not, drivers are unaware that they commit potentially-aggressive actions daily. To increase awareness and promote driver safety, we are proposing a novel system that uses Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and smartphone based sensor-fusion (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, GPS, video) to detect, recognize and record these actions without external processing. Our system differs from past driving pattern recognition research by fusing related inter-axial data from multiple sensors into a single classifier. It also utilizes Euler representation of device attitude (also based on fused data) to aid in classification. All processing is done completely on the smartphone.},

  abstract = {Many conventional distinction methods of road surface condition using car-mounted cameras have been already proposed. However, most of these methods are only effective for daytime and bright conditions. Therefore, we need to expand these methods for impractical night-time that is much more dangerous environment. In this paper, we propose a new distinction method for road surface conditions at night-time, such as dry, wet and snow. This method uses only video information acquired by an inexpensive car-mounted video camera and uses the difference in road surface features for each condition. The image features of the road surface are depending on the illuminant conditions such as street lamps, signal lights, reflections and other lighting sources. Therefore, we analyze the image features based on color information and the presence of other light sources. As a result, the distinction of road surface conditions was achieved with high accuracy, including the areas illuminated by street lamps and other light sources.},

Prior work in this area has required the deployment of dedicated sensors on vehicles and/or on the roadside, or the tracking of mobile phones by service providers. Furthermore, prior work has largely focused on the developed world, with its relatively simple traffic flow patterns. In fact, traffic flow in cities of the developing regions, which comprise much of the world, tends to be much more complex owing to varied road conditions (e.g., potholed roads), chaotic traffic (e.g., a lot of braking and honking), and a heterogeneous mix of vehicles (2-wheelers, 3-wheelers, cars, buses, etc.). To monitor road and traffic conditions in such a setting, we present Nericell, a system that performs rich sensing by piggybacking on smartphones that users carry around with them. In this demo, we show the use of accelerometer to detect bumps and braking. We also use the microphone to enable honk detection. Nericell addresses several challenges including virtually reorienting the accelerometer on a phone that is at an arbitrary orientation, and performing honk detection and localization in an energy efficient manner.},

For example, themonitoring of employee e-mails by employers to prevent them fromwasting organisation's resources on non-business activities. Thisarticle seeks to investigate security, privacy and ethical dilemmas inthe electronic records management environment in the South Africanpublic sector. In order to draw inferences and recommendations, asurvey was conducted on existing national government departmentsin South Africa. Firstly, findings of the literature review (contentanalysis) are discussed. Secondly, the results from the survey areanalysed and interpreted. The article concludes by arguing that withouta proper information security framework and professional code ofethics that embrace electronic records management, governmentdepartments could expose themselves to unnecessary financiallosses due to litigations resulting from invasion of privacy and unethical behaviour, and urges government departments in South Africa to implement Electronic Document and Records Management Systems that are able to capture records in read-only format and generate a non-editable audit trail of all actions to address security dilemmas of electronic records.}

  abstract = {During the past decade, there have been many regional, national and European projects focused on the development of platforms for secure access and sharing of distributed patient information. A platform is needed because present local or enterprise-wide information systems are typically not intended for cross-organisational secure access of patient data. Most of the present secure platforms are local or regional. Commonly used platform types in the health care environment vary from secure point-to-point communication systems to internet-based portals. This paper defines an enhanced cross-security platform which makes it possible for different kinds of local, regional, and national health information systems to communicate in a secure way. The proposed evolutionary way interconnects regional or national security domains with the help of a cross-platform zone. A more revolutionary model based on peer-to-peer Grid like networks and dynamic security credentials is also discussed. The proposed evolutionary model uses cross-domain security and interoperability services to ensure secure communication and interoperability between different security domains. The platform supports both communication defined beforehand and adhoc dynamic access to distributed electronic health records (EHRs). The internet is proposed as the "glue" between different regional or national security domains.}

His first plays were written later than, or contemporary with, those of Aeschylus; and earlier than, or contemporary with, those of Euripides. Sophocles wrote over 120 plays, but only seven have survived in a complete form: Ajax, Antigone, Women of Trachis, Oedipus Rex, Electra, Philoctetes and Oedipus at Colonus. For almost fifty years, Sophocles was the most celebrated playwright in the dramatic competitions of the city-state of Athens which took place during the religious festivals of the Lenaea and the Dionysia. He competed in thirty competitions, won twenty-four, and was never judged lower than second place. Aeschylus won thirteen competitions, and was sometimes defeated by Sophocles; Euripides won four.The most famous tragedies of Sophocles feature Oedipus and Antigone: they are generally known as the Theban plays, though each was part of a different tetralogy (the other members of which are now lost). Sophocles influenced the development of drama, most importantly by adding a third actor (attributed to Sophocles by Aristotle; to Aeschylus by Themistius), thereby reducing the importance of the chorus in the presentation of the plot. He also developed his characters to a greater extent than earlier playwrights.},

Variations include the speed hump, speed cushion, and speed table. The use of vertical deflection devices is widespread around the world, and they are most commonly found to enforce a low speed limit, under 40 km/h (25 mph) or lower. Although speed bumps are effective in keeping vehicle speeds down, their use is sometimes controversial\textemdash as they can increase traffic noise, may damage vehicles if traversed at too great a speed, and slow emergency vehicles. Poorly-designed speed bumps that stand too tall or with too-sharp an angle can be disruptive for drivers, and may be difficult to navigate for vehicles with low ground clearance, even at very low speeds. Many sports cars have this problem with such speed bumps. Speed bumps can also pose serious hazards to motorcyclists and bicyclists if they are not clearly visible, though in some cases a small cut across the bump allows those vehicles to traverse without impediment. Speed bumps cost \$50\textendash 200 and may need replacement over time due to wear.},

The biomedical literature does not yet adequately describe the potential capabilities and utility of PHR systems. In addition, the lack of a proven business case for widespread deployment hinders PHR adoption. In a 2005 working symposium, the American Medical Informatics Association's College of Medical Informatics discussed the issues surrounding personal health record systems and developed recommendations for PHR-promoting activities. Personal health record systems are more than just static repositories for patient data; they combine data, knowledge, and software tools, which help patients to become active participants in their own care. When PHRs are integrated with electronic health record systems, they provide greater benefits than would stand-alone systems for consumers. This paper summarizes the College Symposium discussions on PHR systems and provides definitions, system characteristics, technical architectures, benefits, barriers to adoption, and strategies for increasing adoption.},
