  abstract = {Monitoring road and traffic conditions in a city is a problem widely studied. Several methods have been proposed towards addressing this problem. Several proposed techniques require dedicated hardware such as GPS devices and accelerometers in vehicles [7][15][8] or cameras on roadside and near traffic signals [13]. All such methods are expensive in terms of monetary cost and human effort required. We propose Wolverine - a non-intrusive method that uses sensors present on smartphones. We extend a prior study [12] to improve the algorithm based on using accelerometer, GPS and magnetometer sensor readings for traffic and road conditions detection. We are specifically interested in identifying braking events - frequent braking indicates congested traffic conditions - and bumps on the roads to characterize the type of road. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method based on experiments conducted on the roads in Mumbai, with promising results.},

  abstract = {The haversine formula determines the great-circle distance between two points on a sphere given their longitudes and latitudes. Important in navigation, it is a special case of a more general formula  in spherical trigonometry, the law of haversines, that relates the sides and angles of spherical triangles. The first table of haversines in English was published by James Andrew in 1805, but Florian Cajori credits an earlier use by Jos\'e de Mendoza y R\'ios in 1801. The term haversine was coined in 1835 by James Inman.These names follow from the fact that they are customarily written in terms of the haversine function, given by hav(\texttheta ) = sin2(\texttheta/2). The formulas could equally be written in terms of any multiple of the haversine, such as the older versine function (twice the haversine). Prior to the advent of computers, the elimination of division and multiplication by factors of two proved convenient enough that tables of haversine values and logarithms were included in 19th- and early 20th-century navigation and trigonometric texts.  These days, the haversine form is also convenient in that it has no coefficient in front of the sin2 function.},

Understanding and recognizing driving events that fall into these categories can aid in vehicle safety systems. Potentially-aggressive driving behavior is currently a leading cause of traffic fatalities in the United States. More often than not, drivers are unaware that they commit potentially-aggressive actions daily. To increase awareness and promote driver safety, we are proposing a novel system that uses Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and smartphone based sensor-fusion (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, GPS, video) to detect, recognize and record these actions without external processing. Our system differs from past driving pattern recognition research by fusing related inter-axial data from multiple sensors into a single classifier. It also utilizes Euler representation of device attitude (also based on fused data) to aid in classification. All processing is done completely on the smartphone.},

However, most of these methods are only effective for daytime and bright conditions. Therefore, we need to expand these methods for impractical night-time that is much more dangerous environment. In this paper, we propose a new distinction method for road surface conditions at night-time, such as dry, wet and snow. This method uses only video information acquired by an inexpensive car-mounted video camera and uses the difference in road surface features for each condition. The image features of the road surface are depending on the illuminant conditions such as street lamps, signal lights, reflections and other lighting sources. Therefore, we analyze the image features based on color information and the presence of other light sources. As a result, the distinction of road surface conditions was achieved with high accuracy, including the areas illuminated by street lamps and other light sources.},

Prior work in this area has required the deployment of dedicated sensors on vehicles and/or on the roadside, or the tracking of mobile phones by service providers. Furthermore, prior work has largely focused on the developed world, with its relatively simple traffic flow patterns. In fact, traffic flow in cities of the developing regions, which comprise much of the world, tends to be much more complex owing to varied road conditions (e.g., potholed roads), chaotic traffic (e.g., a lot of braking and honking), and a heterogeneous mix of vehicles (2-wheelers, 3-wheelers, cars, buses, etc.). To monitor road and traffic conditions in such a setting, we present Nericell, a system that performs rich sensing by piggybacking on smartphones that users carry around with them. In this demo, we show the use of accelerometer to detect bumps and braking. We also use the microphone to enable honk detection. Nericell addresses several challenges including virtually reorienting the accelerometer on a phone that is at an arbitrary orientation, and performing honk detection and localization in an energy efficient manner.},

Variations include the speed hump, speed cushion, and speed table. The use of vertical deflection devices is widespread around the world, and they are most commonly found to enforce a low speed limit, under 40 km/h (25 mph) or lower. Although speed bumps are effective in keeping vehicle speeds down, their use is sometimes controversial\textemdash as they can increase traffic noise, may damage vehicles if traversed at too great a speed, and slow emergency vehicles. Poorly-designed speed bumps that stand too tall or with too-sharp an angle can be disruptive for drivers, and may be difficult to navigate for vehicles with low ground clearance, even at very low speeds. Many sports cars have this problem with such speed bumps. Speed bumps can also pose serious hazards to motorcyclists and bicyclists if they are not clearly visible, though in some cases a small cut across the bump allows those vehicles to traverse without impediment. Speed bumps cost \$50\textendash 200 and may need replacement over time due to wear.},
